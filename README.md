## What was done?

I continued from the week 7 assignment that I had returned and can be found in the IntroWebProgramminWeek7-repository. 

I had clear vision what I wanted to do with the project. I had imagined platforms that would fall after the player touched it. The shooting was also one of my original ideas and I wanted to use the mouse click for that. I also wanted more spikes and as there was feature where multiple levels were wanted, I decided to add the new spikes in the second level. Originally, I wanted to add sound only to jumping and shooting. Other ones were the plot for the game that had been thought in the original version and responsiveness that I wanted to accomplish. 

I tried to get the platforms working so it would fall down after it had been touched by the player, but I couldn’t get it working. So, I decided to just delete the entity after 5 seconds the player had touched it. I also decided to add a sound to the break so it would be more obvious. 

I had also problems with the shooting but figured it out after some searching. The feature has some cool down after on shot and it depends on the level how long the cooldown is. The idea of the breaking ground also breaking when shooting it came in the end as it was already a player sensitive area.  

The spikes I decided to add in the original game repository. But the second spikes that fall through the platforms I decided to add so the second level would be a bit more difficult.
I also decided to add clearer plot to the game by adding start and end scene so the game wouldn’t start right away, and the coin count would be told at the end. In the end I added sound in addition to the jumping and shooting but also coin collection and for the ground that breaks. The responsiveness was already built in to the code and it scales with the browser.

## What tools were used?

For the base game I used phaser with codesandbox.io. It was the same stack that I had used in the previous assignment. I used them in visual studio code IDE. For bowser I manly used Chrome, but I also tested the game in Safari, Firefox and Edge where the Safari was the only browser that wasn’t compatible with the game. The Safari gave an error that I was from the Phasers own code. 

For pictures I used the phasers dude and the original ground platform. Otherwise, I used clipground.com, pixabay.com and pixalart.com. The credits have been informed in the code. Few of the pictures, like spikes, the breaking ground and the rock that is thrown, I draw my self in the pixalart.com. I found the sounds from openGameArt.org and used cloudconvert.com to convert the sounds from .ogg and .wav to .mp3 files.

## Points for this project?
